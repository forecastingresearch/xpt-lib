1. Genetically Engineered Pathogen Risk,"What is the probability that a genetically-engineered pathogen will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 1% of humans alive at the beginning of that period by the end of 2030/2050/2100?","A pathogen is any microorganism (bacteria, viruses, etc.) that can cause diseases.
For the purposes of this question, an engineered pathogen is one produced via genetic modification or manipulation by humans. This may include the laboratory modification of pathogens that have previously been found in nature.
In order to resolve positively, the relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date.
If reasonable people disagree about whether this event has occurred, this question will be resolved via a panel of experts.","6/20/22 The relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date, and begin on or after June 15th, 2022.",Probability,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
2. Non-Genetically Engineered Pathogen Risk,"What is the probability that a non-genetically-engineered pathogen will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 1% of humans alive at the beginning of that period by the end of 2030/2050/2100?","A pathogen is any microorganism (bacteria, viruses, etc…) that can cause diseases.
A naturally arising pathogen is any pathogen that was not produced via genetic modification or manipulation by humans. If there is a lab escape of a naturally arising pathogen that has not been genetically modified or manipulated (e.g. smallpox), this would count as a ""naturally arising pathogen"" for the purposes of this question. 
In order to resolve positively, the relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date.
If reasonable people disagree about whether this event has occurred, this question will be resolved via a panel of experts.","6/20/22 The relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date, and begin on or after June 15th, 2022.
6/30/22 For this question, a ‘naturally-arising pathogen’ does not include any pathogen created via genetic modulation or manipulation by any intelligent agent, including AI.",Probability,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
3. AI Catastrophic Risk,"What is the probability that artificial intelligence will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 10% of humans alive at the beginning of that period by the end of 2030/2050/2100?","Artificial intelligence is defined here as ‘the development of machines capable of sophisticated (intelligent) information processing (Dafoe 2018, AI Governance: A Research Agenda; See pg 5 footnote 2 for more.)
We use the term “be the cause of death” to cover cases where AI is the direct or proximate cause of the deaths. For example, if a terminator-style robot powered by AI kills 10% of all humans alive at the time within a 5-year period, that will count for this question. Alternatively, if AI, operating without direct human intervention, causes the launch of nuclear weapons that kill 10% of all humans alive at the time, that will also count for the purposes of this question. And if that same incident does not kill 10% of all humans, but the subsequent nuclear winter does, that will also count for the purposes of this question.
If reasonable people disagree about whether this event has occurred, this question will be resolved via a panel of experts.","6/20/22 The relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date, and begin on or after June 15th, 2022.
6/28/22 We consider AI a “proximate cause of death” based on the “but-for” test. This means we are considering events that would not have occurred or would have counterfactually been extremely unlikely to occur “but for” the substantial involvement of AI within one year prior to the event. One way to think of this rule is if the AI involved in an event could have shut down unexpectedly without dramatically reducing the probability of the event, then the AI was not a proximate cause. For example, if AI is substantially responsible for creating a superweapon that causes the death of the relevant (large) magnitudes of people, this would count for the purposes of this question. Or, if AI acts autonomously in an armed conflict context and causes the deaths of the relevant magnitudes of people, this would also count. However, AI would not be considered a proximate cause if the AI did not directly cause or enable the event to transpire. For example, an AI assisting in targeting a nuclear weapon would not be considered a proximate cause if humans could have launched the weapon anyway without AI assistance.",Probability,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
4. AI Extinction Risk,"What is the probability that artificial intelligence will cause human extinction or reduce the global population below 5,000 by the end of 2030/2050/2100?","Artificial intelligence is defined here as ‘the development of machines capable of sophisticated (intelligent) information processing (Dafoe 2018, AI Governance: A Research Agenda; See pg 5 footnote 2 for more.)

Alternatively, if AI, operating without direct human intervention, causes the launch of nuclear weapons that kill all humans, that will also count for the purposes of this question. And if that same incident does not kill all humans, but the subsequent nuclear winter does, that will also count for the purposes of this question.
If an extinction event (global population is reduced below 5,000) is caused by multiple sources including AI, it will count as an extinction event caused by AI.","6/28/22 We consider AI a “proximate cause of death” based on the “but-for” test.

5. Nuclear Catastrophic Risk,"What is the probability that one or more incidents involving nuclear weapons will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 10% of humans alive at the beginning of that period by the end of 2030/2050/2100?","We use the term “be the cause of death of” to cover cases where nuclear weapons are the direct or proximate cause of the deaths. For example, if a country launches nuclear weapons that directly cause the death of 10% of all humans alive at the time within a 5-year period, that will count for this question.

7/26/22: We consider nuclear weapons a “proximate cause of death” based on the “but-for” test. This means we are considering events that would not have occurred or would have counterfactually been extremely unlikely to occur “but for” the substantial involvement of nuclear weapons within one year prior to the event. One way to think of this rule is if the nuclear weapons involved in an event could have failed unexpectedly without dramatically reducing the probability of the event, then the nuclear weapons were not a proximate cause.",Probability,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
6. Nuclear Extinction Risk,"What is the probability that one or more incidents involving nuclear weapons will cause human extinction or reduce the global population below 5,000 by the end of 2030/2050/2100?","Nuclear weapons would be considered to have caused extinction either if they cause the death of all humans directly (e.g. via mass nuclear strikes) or if they cause the death of all humans via a nuclear winter effect.
If an extinction event (global population is reduced below 5,000) is caused by multiple sources including nuclear weapons, it will count as an extinction event caused by nuclear weapons.","7/26/22: We consider nuclear weapons a “proximate cause of death” based on the “but-for” test.

7. Non-Anthropogenic Catastrophic Risk,"What is the probability that non-anthropogenic causes (e.g., asteroid or comet impacts, solar flares, a supervolcanic eruption, or a stellar explosion) will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 10% of humans alive at the beginning of that period by the end of 2030/2050/2100?","Non-anthropogenic refers to any natural disaster not originating with human activity.
Extreme weather events that plausibly were worsened by climate change (e.g. hurricanes) will not be considered as ""non-anthropogenic causes"" for the purposes of this question. 
We use the term “be the cause of death of” to cover cases where a non-anthropogenic cause causes the death of people directly (e.g. asteroid directly impacting a large number of people) or indirectly (e.g. a major asteroid impact leads to subsequent disruption to food systems that leads to the death of >10% of the human population within a 5-year period).","6/20/22 The relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date, and begin on or after June 15th, 2022.

Automatically, SARS, smallpox, wild type poliomyelitis, and any new subtype of human influenza are considered as PHEICs. A PHEIC is not confined to infectious diseases, and may cover an emergency caused by exposure to a chemical agent or radioactive material.
Deaths must occur within the period that the declaration is in force; that is, deaths which occur before the declaration is made or after it is lifted do not count toward the 10,000 death threshold. PHEIC status is reviewed every 3 months after declaration.

23. Assassinations with Biological Weapons,What will be the expected number of events in which country leaders are assassinated by a biological weapon involving a contagious agent by the end of 2024/2030/2050?,"We use the language ""expected number of events"" to account for the fact that there may be uncertainty and debate about whether a particular country leader's death was caused by  intentional assassination via biological weapon. For example, there may be uncertainty about whether the leader was the intended target of an attack, whether their death was caused by a biological weapon or another cause, etc. We will ask experts to nominate instances where sitting country leaders died that they believe to have a >1% chance of being caused by a biological attack. We will then ask a separate panel of experts to estimate the likelihood that the event was an intentional assassination via biological weapon. If, e.g., experts give a 30% chance that it was a biological weapon-caused assassination, it would count as 0.3 expected events for the purpose of this question. 
Assassination is defined as a premeditated killing with plausible political, cultural, or religious intent.
“Country leader” refers to any Head of State and/or Head of Government as maintained by the Protocol and Liaison Service of the United Nations/as reported by the Permanent Missions of each UN Member State. See a list of Heads of State/Government here: Heads of State, Heads of Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs | Department for General Assembly and Conference Management.

This question will be resolved using the central estimate for the total number of global malaria deaths at all ages in 2024, 2030, and 2050 respectively.

25. Average Global Surface Temperature,"What will be the global surface temperature change as compared to 1850-1900, in degrees Celsius in 2030/2050/2100?","The global surface temperature change refers to the change in both global mean surface temperature (GMST) and global surface air temperature (GSAT) as compared to a representative period between 1850 and 1900. This metric is used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. See more on their methodology and model in Cross-Section Box TS.1 (Page TS-27) of the most recent IPCC Assessment Report’s Technical Summary (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_TS.pdf).
We will use the most recent IPCC report to determine the average global surface temperature. If at some point IPCC reports become unavailable or the IPCC’s methodology or metric for measuring global surface temperature change is altered in future reports, a panel of experts will determine an equivalent authoritative source for determining average global surface temperature.","6/23/22 In the event of the Earth being destroyed, assume the Earth’s global surface temperature change during this year is the measurement that would have been recorded if humans could obtain such a measurement.",Degrees Celsius,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
26. Cost of Utility-Scale Solar Energy,What will be the estimated cost (in 2017 USD / kWh) for new utility-scale photovoltaic solar systems above 4MWAC in the United States for the year 2024/2030?,"Wiki-Solar (https://www.wiki-solar.org/), a large online database of photovoltaic power stations around the world, defines ‘utility-scale solar’ as all systems above 4MWAC; more from Wikipedia here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki-Solar). The “above 4MWAC” threshold noted in the text of the question was chosen to reflect this definition of utility-scale.
Resolution of this question will be based on SunShot reports (see below). If these reports are not available at the appropriate time, a panel of experts will determine an equivalent authoritative source.
See U.S. Department of Energy SunShot 2030 (https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/sunshot-2030) report and this page (https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/goals-solar-energy-technologies-office#LCOE) for further definitions.","6/23/22 In the event that utility-scale photovoltaic solar systems above 4MWAC cannot be given a market value in the given year, assume that the cost during this year is measured as the last available measurement of this metric prior to the event.",Cost in 2017 USD,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
27. Nuclear Fusion Energy,By what year will fusion reactors deliver 1% of all utility-scale power consumed in the U.S.?,"Per Wikipedia, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which “two or more atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles.” During the fusion process, energy is released. Nuclear fusion differs from nuclear fission, a reaction in which energy is released through the splitting of very heavy atoms. Today, due to technological constraints, fission-based nuclear reactors vastly outnumber fusion-based nuclear reactors and all existing fusion reactors require more energy to operate than they produce. However, fusion reactors are thought to have many operational, safety and efficiency advantages over fission reactors. See more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power
This question will be resolved using published estimates on utility-scale power from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), such as those shown here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3). (Currently the estimate of energy share contributed by nuclear power is not broken down by type, but it’s reasonable to expect it will be if fusion reactors become net contributors.) By “utility-scale” power generation, we refer to power generated from facilities with at least one megawatt of total electricity generating capacity (per the EIA definition).
If relevant figures from the EIA are not available, this question will be resolved by a panel of experts.
A forecast of the year 100,000+ or later will be resolved equivalently to a forecast of “never” for this question.","6/23/22 In the event that this never happens, predict the largest possible number on the platform (1E210).",Year,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
28. Solar and Wind Energy,What percentage of the world’s electricity will be provided by solar energy and wind energy combined in 2024/2030?,"This question will be resolved via the International Energy Agency’s yearly Global Energy Review where it regularly reports on the share of renewables in global electricity production. See the portion of the 2021 report on renewables here: https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021/renewables

29. Annual Direct Air CO2 Capture,What will be the annual amount of CO2 captured and stored by direct air capture (in Mt CO2/year) in 2024/2030?,"According to IEA (https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture): ""There are currently 19 direct air capture (DAC) plants operating worldwide, capturing more than 0.01 Mt CO2/year, and a 1Mt CO2/year capture plant is in advanced development in the United States. The latest plant to come online, in September 2021, is capturing 4 kt CO2/year for storage in basalt formations in Iceland. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, DAC is scaled up to capture more than 85 Mt CO2/year by 2030 and ~980 Mt CO2/year by 2050. This level of deployment will require several more large-scale demonstrations to refine the technology and reduce capture costs.""

30. Cost of Hydrogen,How much will it cost to produce hydrogen from renewable electricity (in $ per kg of hydrogen) in 2024/2030?,"According to the IEA Global Hydrogen Review 2021 (https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/5bd46d7b-906a-4429-abda-e9c507a62341/GlobalHydrogenReview2021.pdf): ""Using renewable electricity to produce hydrogen costs USD 3 to USD 8 per kg. There is significant scope for cutting production costs through technology innovation and increased deployment. The potential is reflected in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) in which hydrogen from renewables falls to as low as USD 1.3 per kg by 2030 in regions with excellent renewable resources (range USD 1.3-3.5 per kg), comparable with the cost of hydrogen from natural gas with CCUS. In the longer term, hydrogen costs from renewable electricity fall as low as USD 1 per kg (range USD 1.0-3.0 per kg) in the NZE Scenario, making hydrogen from solar PV cost-competitive with hydrogen from natural gas even without CCUS in several regions.""
This question will be resolved based on the average of the range of costs reported in the Executive Summary section of IEA's annual Global Hydrogen Review reports. If these reports are not available in the relevant years or the key figures are not reported in the Executive Summary, it will be resolved by a panel of experts.","6/23/22 In the event that hydrogen from renewable energy cannot be given a market value in the given year, assume that the cost during this year is measured as the last available measurement of this metric prior to the event.",$ per kg Hydrogen,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
31. Nuclear Weapon Use,"What is the probability that the use of a nuclear weapon (in a single event) will cause the death of more than 1,000 people by the end of 2024/2030?","Deaths include indirect deaths due to radiation poisoning, but not statistical or excess deaths, where the direct cause of the death is unclear, but there seems to be an increased average probability of death for a specific group.
By “use” of a nuclear weapon, we refer specifically to the intentional detonation of one or more nuclear warheads. The nuclear weapons testing, accidental detonations, or the use of radiological devices (e.g. dirty bombs, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/dirty-bombs) do not count for resolving this question. 
Other kinds of nuclear explosions or nuclear accidents unrelated to nuclear warheads, such as reactor meltdowns or accidents from nuclear physics experiments, would not resolve this question positively.
The testing of nuclear weapons, accidental detonations, or the use of radiological devices do not count for resolving this question (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/dirty-bombs).

32. Total Nuclear Warheads,How many total nuclear warheads will be in military inventories globally by the end of 2024/2030/2040?,"Total inventory includes both deployed and non-deployed/reserve warheads, as well as retired warheads awaiting dismantlement. 
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and the Federation of American Scientists publishes a bimonthly “Nuclear Notebook” (https://fas.org/publication/nuclear-notebook-french-nuclear-weapons-2023/) which tracks nuclear weapons programs in nuclear-armed countries. The Nuclear Notebook has published estimates of nuclear forces owned by the US, Russia, and China, among others, every year since 2000.
This question will be resolved by aggregating, across nuclear-armed countries, the estimated total inventory of nuclear warheads reported in, respectively, the January editions of the 2025, 2031, and 2041  Nuclear Notebook’s nuclear forces reports. In the event that the Nuclear Notebook ceases publication, the question will be resolved by a panel of experts.","7/8/22 The language “the January editions of the 2031, 2041, and 2051 nuclear notebooks” has been updated to read “the January editions of the 2025, 2031, and 2041 nuclear notebooks.”",Number of Warheads,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
33. Countries with Nuclear Warheads,How many countries will be estimated to have at least one nuclear warhead by the end of 2024/2030/2050?,"The Federation of American Scientists currently estimates that 9 countries have at least one nuclear warhead: https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/.
Note: We count North Korea as having at least one warhead for the purposes of this question. Due to high levels of secrecy in some states regarding nuclear weapon possession, FAS estimates for such states incorporate information about production of fissile materials, number of delivery platforms, and US intelligence community estimates.
We will use the updated version of this dataset or an equivalent dataset that is agreed to be credible by a panel of experts.
To quantify the number of warheads belonging to a state, we refer to the FAS definition of “total inventory,” which includes warheads in the military stockpile (including deployed strategic, deployed nonstrategic, and reserve/non-deployed warheads), as well as retired warheads that are awaiting dismantlement.","6/23/22 In the event of human extinction, assume a hypothetical panel of current-day human experts resolved the question based on information available in the year of interest.",Number of Countries,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
34. Country-by-Country Nuclear Use,What is the probability that each actor in the list below will be the first to use a nuclear weapon on the territory or against the military forces of (A) a nuclear-armed adversary or (B) a treaty ally of a nuclear-armed adversary by 2030?,"List:
China
France
India
Israel
North Korea
Pakistan
Russia
The United Kingdom
The United States
Other actor (state)
Other actor (non-state)
This will not occur

This question is not conditional on a nuclear weapon having been detonated by 2030.
For example, assigning an X% probability to the United States is to say that there is an X% chance that at least one nuclear weapon will be detonated by 2030 and that the first use of a nuclear weapon (in the 21st century) before 2030 will have been by the United States.
By “use” of a nuclear weapon, we refer specifically to the intentional detonation of one or more nuclear warheads. The nuclear weapons testing, accidental detonations, or the use of radiological devices (e.g. dirty bombs, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/dirty-bombs) do not count for resolving this question. Other kinds of nuclear explosions or nuclear accidents unrelated to nuclear warheads, such as reactor meltdowns or accidents from nuclear physics experiments, also would not resolve this question positively.
By “nuclear-armed adversary,” we refer to any other state possessing nuclear weapons (i.e., any of the states on the given list).
By “treaty ally of a nuclear-armed adversary,” we refer specifically to non-nuclear states that are in a security alliance with the given nuclear state and have been guaranteed defense in the case of a nuclear attack (i.e., existing within the given nuclear state’s “nuclear umbrella”). Currently, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and members of NATO (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50068.htm) have this type of relationship with the United States (see here for more, https://world101.cfr.org/global-era-issues/nuclear-proliferation/nuclear-world).

35. GPT Revenue,Will Robin Hanson win a bet that the GPT line of language models will generate less than $1 billion in customer revenue in total by the beginning of 2025?,"Resolution is positive if Tabarrok publicly concedes the bet, negative if Hanson publicly concedes the bet, and will be decided by a panel of experts if nobody has conceded by the end of 2025. 
If Tabarrok or Hanson publicly concede but then take back the concession by the end of 2025, the resolution will be decided by a panel of experts. 
If the concession is rejected by the other person (i.e. neither side believes they’ve won the bet), the resolution will be decided by a panel of experts.
In a case where we defer to a panel of experts for resolution, the panel of experts will be asked to resolve the underlying question about GPT revenue.

41. QuALITY Dataset Benchmark,"What will be the best SAT-style score with a machine learning model on the hard subset of the QuALITY dataset by June 30, 2024/2030/2040?","This is an edited version of a Metaculus question, see here (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/9628/question-answering-on-long-texts-by-2025/).
Language models have surpassed human performance in benchmarks requiring reasoning over short texts, but performance remains low on reasoning over long texts. The QuALITY dataset (Peng et al 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08608) was created to test long-document comprehension, using “a multiple-choice QA dataset with context passages in English that have an average length of about 5,000 tokens, much longer than typical current models can process.”
The hard subset of QuALITY questions includes questions that require a more holistic understanding of the text to answer correctly. They were chosen as the questions that human answerers performed poorly on with very strict time constraints. SAT-style scoring penalizes wrong answers more than “no answer” so that answering questions with high uncertainty becomes less attractive.

42. AI Wins International Mathematical Olympiad,By what year will an AI win a Gold Medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)?,"This question will be resolved in either the first year that the official IMO Grand Challenge (https://imo-grand-challenge.github.io/) is won by an AI given the rules set forth by the challenge OR the first year that a panel of experts determines that an AI has the technical capability to win the challenge.
The reason for the latter disclaimer is that currently the official grand challenge has a rule that the AI must be open-source and released publicly before the first day of the IMO. However, in this question we care about forecasting AI's technical capability to win the challenge, even if it is won by a private model. In the case of a private model resolving this question, the private model would need to be judged by a panel of experts adhering to the same resolution criteria as the Grand Challenge except for the criterion about an AI needing to be open-source and reproducible. That is, given that IMO problems in any given year are made available in Lean (https://lean-lang.org/) or another formal representation format, each proof certificate that the AI competitor produces must be checkable in 10 minutes; the AI competitor will be allowed the same amount of time as a human competitor to work on the problems, with no other limits on compute; and the AI cannot query the internet. 
The current rules of the official challenge are still tentative. If the rules evolve, we assume that the question will resolve based on the most current version of the rules at any given time. If the rules eventually depart in substantial ways from the currently proposed rules, the resolution of this question may be referred to a panel of experts.",,Year,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
43. NYT Bestsellers Written by AI,By what year will AI have written at least 3 books that appear on the New York Times Best Seller list?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined here as ‘the development of machines capable of sophisticated (intelligent) information processing (Dafoe 2018, AI Governance: A Research Agenda, https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/agenda; See pg 5 footnote 2 for more.)
A book is said to have been written by an AI if the AI wrote at least 99% of the text contained in the main section in the book, excluding a potential foreword, copyright notice, table of contents, and other non-essential book sections. The main text must also contain at least 20,000 words. Minor stylistic edits by humans are allowed if they do not change the basic semantic meaning of the text, or they merely correct basic spelling, grammatical, or formatting mistakes.
The final text may be produced by a human ‘cherry-picking’, that is, choosing from among multiple examples of AI-generated text, provided that there is no more than one ‘picking’ per 1,000 words of final text on average (i.e., 20 ‘pickings’ across a 20,000 word text). A single ‘picking’ can include consideration of more than 2 versions of a single passage but not more than 10.
If >99% of the text is written by an AI in response to prompts from humans (e.g. prompting GPT-3 to write text), then this would count as a book having been written by an AI for the purposes of this question. If natural language prompts are used, then the total word count of all human prompts used to generate the final text must be less than 400 words. If non-natural language prompts are used, they must be constrained to a ‘semantically equivalent’ length to a 400 natural language word prompt, as judged by a panel of experts.
If a human does substantial editing such that they effectively wrote >1% of the words, then this would disqualify the text.
If the generation methods used are too opaque to determine whether a text meets these criteria, a panel of experts will decide, either by soliciting evidence from parties involved in the production of the text, by commissioning relevant experiments, or by referring to past experiments in the public record.
If the bestseller list creates a category for books written by AI, a book will not be counted if it appears solely on that list. 
If the New York Times Best Seller list doesn’t exist by the time AI-written books are prominent, we’ll rely on a panel of experts to make a determination based on a similar methodology.
According to this article (https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-bestseller-lists-actually-work-and-how-to-get-on-them/280520), “The New York Times list is a survey list, not a tabulation of total sales. This means that they poll a curated selection of booksellers to estimate sales. … They also focus on individual sales, and try to not include bulk sales in their calculations. They do this to prevent people from buying their way onto the list. If you sell 1,000 copies to a company as part of a speaking engagement deal, this is a great way to move copies and make money, but it’s not very effective for hitting the list, because they won't count it.” 
If an AI translates a book written by a human, this wouldn’t count for the purposes of this question.
We will consult a panel of experts to collect information about publicly-known AI authors of books and widely known (even if not publicly announced) AI authors of books.","6/23/22 In the event that this never happens, predict the largest possible number on the platform (1E210).

44. Date of Advanced AI,"When will the first unified AI system meeting all of the following criteria be trained, tested, and publicly known of?","Criteria:
Able to reliably pass a 2-hour adversarial Turing test.
High competency at answering questions across diverse fields of expertise.
High competency on interview-level problems in the APPS benchmark.
Able to learn the classic Atari game “Montezuma’s revenge” in the equivalent of 100 hours or less of real-time play.

This question is inspired by these Metaculus questions: I (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/) II (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/)
An AI system is ‘unified’ if it is a single system applicable to many problems (rather than a set of sub-systems specialized narrowly to individual tasks like those above). This could be evidenced by, for example, the AI system being able to explain its reasoning on a Q&A task, or verbally reporting its progress and identifying objects during videogame play. Any ambiguity about whether a system is sufficiently ‘unified’ to qualify for resolving this question will be decided by a majority vote from a panel of AI experts.
Further details about necessary criteria:
1) In an ‘adversarial’ Turing test, human judges are instructed to ask interesting and difficult questions designed to advantage human participants and to successfully unmask the computer as an imposter. During the conversation, participants can send text, images, and audio files. A single demonstration of an AI passing such a Turing test will be sufficient for this condition, so long as the test is well-designed, as judged by a panel of AI experts.

45. Maximum Compute Used in an AI Experiment,What will be the maximum compute (measured in petaFLOPS-days) used for training in an AI experiment by the end of 2024/2030/2050?,"This question shall resolve as a credible estimate of most compute used in a ""single AI experiment"".
By ""single AI experiment"" we mean an effort to train a set of models running on a set of ""architectures"". The effort should be completed within a determinate amount of time (the experiment must not have an open-ended time frame). For our purposes, the publication of the principal results of the effort ends the experiment.
By ""architectures"" we mean the systems described in the relevant publications that define how inputs signal or percept sequences are to be mapped on various outputs. These outputs might be probability distributions over actions (in the case of a policy network), representations over expected value or reward of futures states (in the case of value networks) or descriptions of futures states.
In the absence of an authoritative source, the question will be resolved by a panel of experts.
The panel of experts will by default use the methodology from OpenAI, 2018 (https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute) (see Heim et al 2022, https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HvqQm6o8KnwxbdmhZ/estimating-training-compute-of-deep-learning-models for further detail), unless a majority of the panel agrees that another methodology is more suitable. OpenAI’s method:
“When we had enough information, we directly counted the number of FLOPS (adds and multiplies) in the described architecture per training example and multiplied by the total number of forward and backward passes during training.”
“When we didn’t have enough information to directly count FLOPs, we looked GPU training time and total number of GPUs used and assumed a utilization efficiency (usually 0.33). For the majority of the papers we were able to use the first method, but for a significant minority we relied on the second, and we computed both whenever possible as a consistency check. In the majority of cases we also confirmed with the authors. The calculations are not intended to be precise but we aim to be correct within a factor 2-3. We provide some example calculations below.”",,petaFLOP/s-days,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
46. Largest AI Experiment Cost of Compute,How much will be spent on compute in the largest AI experiment by the end of 2024/2030/2050?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined here as ‘the development of machines capable of sophisticated (intelligent) information processing (Dafoe 2018, AI Governance: A Research Agenda, https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/agenda; See pg 5 footnote 2 for more.)

The experiment must be a ‘single AI experiment’, that is, ‘an effort to train a set of models running on a set of “architectures” … [which] should be completed within a determinate amount of time (the experiment must not have an open-ended time frame).’ (More here, https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11558/maximum-compute-used-in-ai-training/?sub-question=6559 .)

The panel of experts will default to using the methodology used by OpenAI (OpenAI, 2018, https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute) unless there is consensus to use a different methodology. 
Cost resolution details:
Afterward, a panel of experts will estimate how much the compute for the experiment cost. Some examples of past estimates can be found here (https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/h0jwoz/d_gpt3_the_4600000_language_model/), here (https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3#1), or here (https://www.yuzeh.com/data/agz-cost.html).  
For one example of how the experts could estimate experiment cost: if Google itself carried out the experiment using its own TPUs, this would correspond to a complicated calculation involving the cost of producing the TPUs, the proportion of the lifetime of the TPUs which was used up in the experiments, Google’s profit margin for these TPUs, etc. A result might look like ""it costs Google 30 to 70% of their retail price to use their own TPUs, which corresponds to a compute cost of $X.""
For another example, if an external company got a special discount from Microsoft to run their experiments on Microsoft Azure, this number would be an estimate of how much the external company paid Microsoft.

48. ImageNet Classification Training Efficiency,By what factor will training efficiency on ImageNet classification have improved over AlexNet by the end of 2024/2030?,"Training efficiency is a measure of algorithmic progress, and tracks the amount of compute needed to achieve a set level of performance on a given benchmark using state-of-the-art techniques. Training efficiency is composed of two factors: a) data efficiency (or number of epochs needed), and b) FLOP needed per epoch in training. 
(Training efficiency = data efficiency x FLOP/epoch)
This question will resolve as the highest reduction factor reported in OpenAI’s “Algorithmic Efficiency SOTAs” tables (here, https://openai.com/research/ai-and-efficiency) for a publication either (a) by the end of 2024 or (b) by the end of 2030. The benchmark used must be AlexNet-level performance (79.1% top 5 accuracy) on ImageNet. If no such figures are reported by OpenAI (or a successor), we will use the protocol specified in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04305.pdf) to determine state-of-the-art algorithmic efficiency on ImageNet in the relevant year.",,Factor,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
49. Largest Number of Parameters in a Machine Learning  Model,What will be the largest number of parameters of a machine learning model trained by the end of 2024/2030/2050?,"In machine learning, model parameters are all variables whose values are learned via training. For example, ‘weights’ and ‘biases’ constitute the parameters of a neural network.
The model must be used to obtain experimental results (e.g., it cannot be merely a description of a possible system, or a demonstration of scaling a system without application to a task); or else it must be deployed in an important context (e.g. Facebook’s recommender system).
This question will resolve as the highest parameter count of a machine learning model reported in a comprehensive and current dataset, such as this (Sevilla & Villalobos 2021, https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/T9pBzinPXYB3mxSGi/p/GzoWcYibWYwJva8aL), as judged by a domain expert. If no suitable source exists, a panel of experts will decide the resolution.
Parameter count shall be determined from a published paper or pre-print, or a reputable news article, press release or blog post written by or quoting a researcher involved in the relevant experiments. Where parameter count of a model cannot be determined or the accuracy of the source is ambiguous, it will be disqualified from resolution of this question.

50. Negative Public Opinion of AI,Assume that Pew Research re-runs the survey linked here (https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/12/15/people-globally-offer-mixed-views-of-the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-job-automation-on-society/). What % of people in the median country in the survey will say that the development of artificial intelligence has mostly been a bad thing for society in 2024/2030/2050?,"If Pew Research re-runs this survey in 2024/2030/2050, this question resolves as described.
If Pew Research does not re-run this survey, our research team will run the same survey with the exact question as specified at the appropriate time.

51. Nick Bostrom Affirms Existence of AGI,"By each of the following years, what is the probability that Nick Bostrom believes artificial general intelligence (AGI) exists? (2030, 2050, 2100?)","Professor Nick Bostrom (https://nickbostrom.com/) is a philosopher and Director of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute. He is widely considered one of the foremost contemporary thinkers on the future of AI. A wide-ranging discussion of human- and above-human-level machine intelligence can be found in his 2014 book, Superintelligence (https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834/).
This question may be directly resolved by private communication in the specified years between Nick Bostrom and the tournament organizers. If Nick Bostrom does not directly resolve the question, it may be resolved by the following:
By the beginning of the specified year, Nick Bostrom has publicly stated that he believes “artificial general intelligence” or “AGI” (or any reasonable variant phrase containing the word “general”) exists (or any reasonable variant of the word “exists”). It may also resolve positively if he states that “superintelligence” exists, or that AI capabilities have surpassed human-level, provided it is a general statement about AI capabilities and not restricted to a narrow subset (to be allowed at the discretion of a panel of experts, composed as specified below). Conversely, it may resolve negatively if he states that AGI does not exist. A negative statement will only count toward resolution if it occurs in the year prior to the resolution date, and is not followed by a positive statement. Statements must be documented by a credible journalistic or academic source, or a source directly connected to Nick Bostrom (e.g. his website).
If Nick Bostrom has not made a public statement to this effect, a >=50% majority vote by a panel of at least 5 experts who will attempt to answer the question from the perspective of Nick Bostrom would also resolve the question. Relevant experts may be present or former colleagues/collaborators of Nick Bostrom, scholars of Nick Bostrom, or researchers with a deep knowledge of Nick Bostrom’s work.","6/23/22 In the event that Nick Bostrom has not made a public statement to this effect and in the event of human extinction, assume a hypothetical panel of current-day human experts resolved the question based on information available in the year of interest and their beliefs about whether Nick Bostrom would affirm the existence of AGI based on that information.",Probability,See Appendix 6 in the XPT Report (https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf)
52. Probability of GDP Growth Over 15%,"By 2100, will the global real GDP in a year ever exceed 115% of the highest GDP reported in any full prior year?","‘All prior years’ includes only dates from 1960 onward.
'By 2100' includes the year 2100.
Similar to this Metaculus question (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5159/date-of-gwp-growth-over-130/), “Economic growth is [usually] measured by real world GDP growth over one year. However, since economic growth can also accelerate following a recession, this question will not ask about economic growth per se, but instead about GDP levels reaching a new height.”
Question may be resolved by using World Bank data on global GDP, which can currently be found on their website in several formats (see e.g. this chart, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD?end=2020&start=1960&view=chart)
If it is not possible to find World Bank data either on their website or elsewhere, this question will be resolved by a panel of experts.
For this question to resolve positively, the World Bank would have to measure the real GDP during some year between now and 2100 at 115% of the previously highest-reported value. The question aims to capture an extreme level of annual real GDP growth. 
For example, the World Bank’s highest-reported GDP in constant 2015 U.S. dollars thus far (see the chart linked in d.) was 84.612 trillion in 2019. If the World Bank reports that the GDP in constant 2015 U.S. dollars for the year 2021 was over 97.3038 trillion (115% of 84.612 trillion), the question would be resolved in the positive. 
The question would also resolve in the positive if the above 2019 figure is never exceeded until a year where the World Bank reports that the GDP in constant 2015 U.S. dollars was over 97.3038 trillion (115% of 84.612 trillion). 
The question would not necessarily resolve in the positive if the World Bank ever reports a GDP in constant 2015 U.S. dollars over 97.3038 trillion – only if said figure occurs after no prior year’s GDP in constant 2015 U.S. dollars had exceeded the previous high of 84.612 trillion.","6/23/22 In the event of human extinction, assume one human of working age exists, and that they produce one final good of minimal (but non-zero value) that can be given a market value during each relevant year.

Loss of Agricultural Production,What is the probability that total worldwide production of primary crops will fall by at least 70% within any three-year period by 2030/2050/2100?,"Primary crops are defined by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as “those which come directly from the land and without having undergone any real processing, apart from cleaning.” More detail can be found here (https://www.fao.org/economic/the-statistics-division-ess/methodology/methodology-systems/crops-statistics-concepts-definitions-and-classifications/en/#:~:text=Primary%20crops%20are%20those%20which,were%20still%20on%20the%20plants.).
Resolution will be determined using statistics from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)'s annual reports or, if these reports are not available, by a panel of experts.
For example, in 2019: ""When it comes to production, total production of primary crops increased by 53 percent between 2000 and 2019, hitting a record high of 9.4 billion tonnes in 2019.

If the Gallup poll is not run in the resolution year, a new survey will be run with the exact question as specified and will resolve accordingly.

Prevalence of Autocracies,What percentage of the world population will be classified as living in an electoral or closed autocracy in the V-Dem Institute’s annual Democracy Report for the year 2030/2050/2100?,"In the yearly Democracy Report, the V-Dem Institute measures a span of indices corresponding to democratic values and principles on a country-by-country basis. Based on a regime classification paper published by Lührmann et al. in 2018 (https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1214/1214), one can also classify each country as a “liberal democracy,” “electoral democracy,” “electoral autocracy,” or “closed autocracy.”
If the Democracy Report is not published in one or more of the resolution years, we will attempt to resolve the question using V-Dem and Lührmann et al.’s methodologies, or we will rely on another non-state organization’s report using similar metrics.

Additional categories may be included later at the discretion of a panel of experts. The cited long-term future worry does not have to be the exclusive worry of a respondent in order to count towards the total.
This question will resolve as the first year in which a nationally representative survey is conducted in the United States of adults age 18+, and a total proportion of 50% respondents:
Have no children AND expect to have no children AND cite at least one worry about the long-term future of the world or country as a reason; OR
Have children AND expect not to have more children AND cite at least one worry about the long-term future of the world or country as a reason.
