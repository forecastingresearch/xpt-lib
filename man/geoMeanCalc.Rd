\usage{
geoMeanCalc(x, q = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of forecasts}

\item{q}{The quantile to use for replacing 0s (between 0 and 1)}
}
\description{
Calculate the geometric mean of a vector of forecasts. We handle 0s by
replacing them with the qth quantile of the non-zero forecasts.
}
\note{
agg(a) + agg(not a) does not sum to 1 for this aggregation method.
