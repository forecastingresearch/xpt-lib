\title{Geometric Mean of Odds}
\usage{
geoMeanOfOddsCalc(x, q = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of forecasts (probabilities!)}

\item{q}{The quantile to use for replacing 0s (between 0 and 1)}
}
\description{
Convert probabilities to odds, and calculate the geometric mean of the
odds. We handle 0s by replacing them with the qth quantile of the non-zero
forecasts, before converting.
}
\note{
agg(a) + agg(not a) does not sum to 1 for this aggregation method.
